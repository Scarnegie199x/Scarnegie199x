Hello and thank you for visting my Github!

I'm currently looking to pivot careers into software development focusing on Python and the Django framework. I've always had a passion for programming and now that I have the time to pursue that opportunity I've created some interesting and exciting projects! 

Feel free to inspect, ask questions, offer feedback or just say hello through my email: Scottcarnegie3@gmail.com
